Welcome to the Nim tours repository
===================================

This is a repository to co-ordinate an effort in creating a multi-part tour of
Nim's features. If you want to write a tour, simply create a new file with your
tour in it, and add it to the index. Also add the topic to this list:

Existing tours

| Tour name | Description                                        | Maintainer|
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| Example   | Just a simple example to show how the tour         | PMunch    |
|           | system works.                                      |           |

Writing new tours
-----------------

The playground supports showing a tour hosted anywhere. So to see how a tour will
look before comitting it to this repo simply upload it somewhere (could even be
a paste-site like https://ix.io) and go to
https://play.nim-lang.org/index.html?tour=<URL escaped link to the tour>
