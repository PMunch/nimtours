  <h1>Welcome to a tour of Nim!</h1>
  <p>Well, what will become the tour of Nim anyways. Currently this is only a
  test of the tour feature to make sure everything works as intended. If you
  have a look at the URL bar you can actually see that you can point the
  playground to display not only this tour, but any site formatted as a tour!
  Pretty neat right? If you go to <a href="http://play.nim-lang.org/tour.html">http://play.nim-lang.org/tour.html</a>
  you can see how this file is structured.</p>
  <p>The main level of your file should be a series of <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>
  tags that contain at least one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element and one
  <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element. The first such header element will
  be displayed below, and the last code element will be displayed as the code
  snippet for that section</p>
  <code># So this would be the code snippet for this section
echo "Hello Nim tour!"</code>
</section>

  <h1>Go forth, create your own</h1>
  <p>So that's really all that I wanted to share right now. Go forth and try out
  the new feature, and make sure to share them on IRC for everyone else to have
  a look!</p>
  <p>An official tour is also in the works and will probably be linked to from
  something like <a href="https://tour.nim-lang.org">https://tour.nim-lang.org</a>
  in the future. If you have anything you would like to be in the official tour
  just create your own and share it with me.</p>
  <code># Notice how this code block only shows up on the right hand side, so
# if you don't have any code you want to share for a section and want to use
# in-line code elements make sure to have an empty code element at the end of
# the section.
echo "Goodbye Nim tour!"</code>
